    <h1 class = "Title"> Academic analysis on data scientist across industries in the United States</h1>
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    In this project, we are aiming to perform critical data analysis, data visualization and data programming skills
    using Javascript and the d3 package on data-based web visualization. This project contains three parts, D3 Programming, Conceptual Questions, and Self/Peer Review, you may find each
    topic under its corresponded section.

    <h2>Introduction: </h2>
    Data science is such an up-and-rising field across the industries. As a future data scientist, we are interested in finding different aspects and expectations of being a data scientist.
    As we are all about to graduate and step onto the professional field. Studying this particular dataset would help us get a better
        sight of the skill sets required and what we will be expecting in the future, to get ourselves acquainted and prepared. It is also a good experience to get familiarize with different companies
        that have job opportunities so that we can prepare ourselves.
    <br><br>Here's a snapshot of the data that we will be using in this project:

    <h4>Dataset Description:</h4> This dataset was originally created by Nikhil Bhathi, a Nuclear Physicist in Canada. The author scraped the data from the Glassdoor website, where it is one of the biggest career searching platform across the United States.
        For academic purpose, we will be using this dataset and perform data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. This dataset was made usable for performing data analysis and modeling. The dataset contains data scientists
        salaries across the United States and also information such as company info, employee sizes, job description, age of the company in years, etc.

            <h3>Q. What is the relationship between age and average salary of data scientists?</h3>
            </div>
            Note: Scatter plot is extremely useful in finding correlations between the variables( Age & avg. Salaries in this case.) Thus, we will be applying the graph using age as x-axis and avg. salary as y-axis to conduct the analysis. <br><br>
            Data Cleaning: This dataset contains ages ranging from -1 to 234 and unrelated careers. We will only be selecting age between 18 and 100 as our critical data as range outside are extreme values that we considered unlikely happen in our life, as well as taking unrelated and invalid careers(such as director and NAs) out of the research.

            <h4>Findings to the visualization</h4> The graph shown that there is a positive relationship between age and average salary of being a data scientist. The positive trend gives the proof. <br>
            In addition, we also observed that data scientists have a higher mean salary on average comparing to the other related field, such as data engineers, data modeler, and analysts.
            Careers such as data analysts and data engineer even has a negative trend towards relationship between age and average salary. <br><br>

            <h3>Q. What are the average ratings across different careers versus data scientists? </h3>
            Data Cleaning: Same age condition applies, we will only be selecting ages between 18 and 100 as our critical data, and invalid careers(NAs) out of the research.

            <h4>Findings to the visualization</h4> Among all of the careers, data modeler has the highest ratings with a almost 4.5 rating. Director scores the second-highest, a around 4.2 rating. <br>On the other hand, data
            scientist has an average rate of 3.7,and it is the forth among all. <br><br>
