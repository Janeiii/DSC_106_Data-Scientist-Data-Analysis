    <h1 class = "Title"> Academic analysis on data scientist across industries in the United States</h1>
    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    In this project, we are aiming to perform critical data analysis, data visualization and data programming skills
    using Javascript and the d3 package on data-based web visualization. This project contains three parts, D3 Programming, Conceptual Questions, and Self/Peer Review, you may find each
    topic under its corresponded section.

    <h2>Introduction: </h2>
    Data science is such an up-and-rising field across the industries. As a future data scientist, we are interested in finding the salary expectations as a data scientist as we are
        all about to graduate and step onto the professional field. Studying this particular dataset would help us get a better
        sight of what skill sets and salary we will be expecting in the future and also to know more about different companies
        that have job opportunities so that we can prepare ourselves.
    <br><br>Here's a snapshot of the data that we will be using in this project:

    <h4>Dataset Description:</h4> This dataset was originally created by Nikhil Bhathi, a Nuclear Physicist in Canada. The author scraped the data from the Glassdoor website, where it is one of the biggest career searching platform across the United States.
        For academic purpose, we will be using this dataset and perform data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. This dataset was made usable for performing data analysis and modeling. The dataset contains data scientists
        salaries across the United States and also information such as company info, employee sizes, job description, age of the company in years, etc.

            <h3>Q. What is the relationship between age and average salary of data scientists?</h3>
            Note: Scatter plot is extremely useful in finding correlations between the variables( Age & avg. Salaries in this case.) Thus, we will be applying the graph using age as x-axis and avg. salary as y-axis to conduct the analysis.

            <h4>Findings to the visualization: Although the data are widely spread out, we could still see a small upward trending happening in the graph, for which it tells us that age and average salaries of data scientist are somehow correlated and a greater age could potentially result a higher average salary.</h4>
